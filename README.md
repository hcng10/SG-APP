# SG-APP: Mobile health for POC testing with multiplexed immunoassay

This software project is/will be composed of the following 3 stages:

1. Machine learning and system design for standard mLFA read-outs
2. Features extraction and classification with ML based on SERS-based mLFA reporters
3. Machine learning model for testing strategy based on mLFA supplemented by SERS-based mLFA and disease surveillance
